# DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE - DIP

"High Level Modules should not depend upon Low Level Modules. Both should depend upon Abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon Details. 
However, details should depend upon abstractions."

We should decouple high level modules from low level modules, introducing an abstraction layer between the high level classes and low level classes. 
To conform to the principle of dependency inversion, we must isolate this abstraction from the details of the problem.
