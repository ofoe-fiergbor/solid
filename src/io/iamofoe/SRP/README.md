# SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE - SRP

"There Should Never Be More Than One Reason for a `Class` to change."

A class or a module must have a specific responsibility and nothing more.

If there is more than one motive for changing a class, then that class is assumed to have more than one responsibility, which results as high coupling.


When SRP is followed, testing is easier. 

With a single responsibility, the class will have fewer test cases. 

Less functionality also means less dependencies to other modules or classes. 

It leads to better code organization since smaller and well-purposed classes are easier to search.

One of the main disadvantages of the SRP principle of SOLID design is too many classes.
