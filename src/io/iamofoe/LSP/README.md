# LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE - LSP

"Derived type must fully support the substitution of their base types."

“If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e. objects
of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that
program (correctness, task performed, etc.).”
