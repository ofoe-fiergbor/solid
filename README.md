# SOLID DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Software design helps you to imagine the overall system and reduces the cost involved in developing and 
supporting the project.

Since it is not an easy task to identify the feasibility of the actual requirements at 
the very start fo the project, therefore the design should support scalability which will 
allow the induction of the new requirements into the software architecture.

The presence of rigidity, fragility, immobility and viscosity results in a poor architecture.

Rigidity specifies the difficulty measure of changing the software.<br>

Fragility is the tendency of the software to break every time it is changed.<br> 

Immobility is the inability to reuse software from the other projects or parts of software from the same project.<br> 

Viscosity is the inability to preserve the design of the system which can degrade if a proper solution is not incorporated pertaining to any changes in the system requirement.

To handle these factors we have some set of guidelines called SOLID design principles.

SOLID acronym for stands:

    <li>S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>        
    <li>O - Open Close Principle (OCP)</li>        
    <li>L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</li>        
    <li>I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</li>        
    <li>D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</li>
